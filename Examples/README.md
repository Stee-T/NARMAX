Welcome to the example / tutorial section. Each example folder contains a python script with the fitting code and an explanation README file displayed as github page.

# Example 1
Covers the basics of the library (functions, algorithm hyper-parameters, etc) and demonstrates how to use the most common signal-constructors and the arborescence.

**Fitted system**: $y\[k\] = 0.2x\[k\] + 0.3x^3\[k-1\] + 0.7|x\[k-2\]x^2\[k-1\]| +0.5e^{x\[k-3\]x\[k-2\]} - \cos(y\[k-1\]x\[k-2\]) -0.4|x\[k-1\]y^2\[k-2\]| - y^3\[k-3\]$

# Example 2
Is a short demonstration of how to fit rational models with the provided signal-constructor. It also contains some supplementary information about the arborescence fitting, including how to reliably reproduce results.

**Fitted system**: $y\[k\]=\frac{0.6|x\[k\]|-0.35x^3\[k\]-0.3x\[k-1\]y\[k-2\]+0.1|y\[k-1\]|}{1-0.4|x\[k\]|+0.3|x\[k-1\]x\[k\]|-0.2x^3\[k-1\]+ 0.3y\[k-1\]x\[k-2\]}$

# Example 3
Is a short demonstration of how to use the imposed regressor dictionary. This example illustrates how to fit a (linear) IIR filter of a desired order.

**Fitted system**: #TODO


# Example 4
Demonstrates how to generate embedded expansions (advanced linearization and order determination) and how to create a custom dictionary and validation function.

**Fitted system**: $y = \text{sgn}(x)(1-\frac{1}{1+|x|A})$ with $Aâ‰”\Sigma_{j\in J}\theta _j |x|^j$ and $J\subseteq \mathbb{N}$.


# Example 5
Demonstrates how to fit MISO (Multiple Input Single Output) systems

**Fitted system**: # TODO
